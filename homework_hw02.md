# A Comparison of NoSQL Database Management Systems and Models

The article has presented and compared RDBMS as relational while NoSQL as distributed database model. While RDBMS uses Structured Query Language (SQL) for managing and accessing data held within the database, NoSQL database does not. NoSQL databases are typically designed to maximize availability at the expense of consistency. However, the NoSQL databases oftentimes aim for eventual consistency with the benefit of improving the availability of oneâ€™s data. NoSQL databases have a reputation for being a better choice for storing semi-structured and unstructured data. The more widely implemented NoSQL database models were discussed including Key-value, Columnar, Document-oriented and Graph Databases. Moreover, commonly NoSQL database and data stores including Cassandra, Apache HBase, MongoDB, Neo4j etc. were explained with examples.

#Introduction to Data Lakes

Data lakes provide a complete and authoritative data store that can power data analytics, BI, and machine learning. The article highlighted data lake as a central location that holds a large amount of data in its native, raw format. They were developed in response to the limitations of data warehouses, which stores data in files or folders.  Meanwhile, Lakehouse avoids the limitations of data warehouse because it is designed to manage all types of data while supporting both traditional data warehouse workloads and machine learning natively. It adds all this functionality to your existing data lake, creating a single open system to both manage all of your data and support every use case. On the other hand, Delta Lake delivers reliability, security and performance on your data lake -essential to building lakehouse architecture on top of existing storage systems such as Amazon S3, Azure Data Lake Store and Google Cloud Storage.
