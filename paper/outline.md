# **Big Data in the Aviation Industry**

# Summary

Big data analysis methods have revolutionized how both government and commercial researchers can analyze massive aviation databases that were previously too cumbersome, inconsistent, or irregular to drive high quality output. The ability to mine massive volumes of data from a myriad of sources to analyze and gain insights has radically altered the dynamics of business functions, marketing, and sales. Aviation as a global enterprise and as one of the biggest industries that have access to various kinds of data from multiple sources. A modern aircraft produces gigabytes of data everyday: operational parameters, technical indicators, logs reports. Moreover, the airline industry has been a customer experience expert (pre-flight and flight) with its successful loyalty programs from the beginning. However, most of the airlines has not taken advantage of big data technology yet. They have an access of great data, and with prioritization in data collection and analysis and could use big data to respond to market trends and customer needs and achieve safety. 

Moreover, leveraging big data insights bring airlines a great competitive advantage. Using various data sources play a role in calculating real-time predicting metrics to present customers with the right offer at the right time. In this sense, airline big data modelling is big business and it’s driving a new revenues for airlines and their loyalty programs. Furthermore, armed with customers behavioral data, airline loyalty programs can hyper-personalized the content customers see, the marketing emails customers receive, and the prices displayed. In this sense, companies can provide the right incentive to the right person at the right time. The ‘How big data is changing the way we fly’ explains how some airline loyalty programs are feeding in behavioral data into their internet booking engines.

This paper aims to study how big data in aviation industry is working and what kinds of information aviation companies and airlines process every day? It also presents a use case on flight performance and visualization with GraphFrames for Apache Spark.
