# Crime Data Analysis and Visualization

Big data analysis plays an essential role in the knowledge discovery process of extracting of interesting patterns or knowledge for understanding various phenomena including crime incidences [1]. The purpose of this project paper is to analyze and visualize crime patterns of Prince George's County, Maryland based on publicly available Crime Incidents data [2]. To achieve this goal, big data processing python package including PySpark will be used to perform data reading, transforming, and querying and analysis. Moreover, existing python libraries including Matplotlib will be used to visualize crime data. 

The rationale is crime incident and pattern analysis will enable for hotspot detection and predictive policing. Moreover, crime pattern analysis uncovers the underlying interactive process between crime events by discovering where, when, and why particular crimes are likely to occur. This will further help tool development in the law enforcement industry and safety of the community. The paper will be organized into 5parts including Introduction, objective, Methodology, Results and Discussion and Conclusions.
