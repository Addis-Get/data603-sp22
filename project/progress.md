## Crime Data Analysis and Visualization Using PySpark in Montgomery County, Maryland 

### Introduction

Data analysis plays an essential role in the knowledge discovery process of extracting of interesting patterns or knowledge for understanding various phenomena including crime incidences. Crime investigation is the use of facts to analyze a crime. It involves systematically studying the crime scene and the evidence gathered. A lot of data is collected when crime investigation is finished, and this data can be used to find useful patterns. It can allow to find geographical locations where a particular type of crime happens frequently and allow police and law enforcement agencies to better respond such crime incidences.

The goal of this project is to analyze and visualize crime patterns and identify crime areas and mapping using PySpark.

The data sources considered as a part of this project include Publicly available datasets that consist of crime activities in Montgomery County, Maryland. Tabular data can beaccessed from dataMontgomery here: https://data.montgomerycountymd.gov/Public-Safety/Crime/icn6-v9z3/data.
